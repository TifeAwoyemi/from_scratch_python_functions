# From Scratch Python Functions

This repository contains my implementations of core Python functions and algorithms written from scratch. 
It serves as a learning sprint to build core skills in and understanding of programming concepts, algorithmic thinking, and Python’s built-in functionalities.
Through rebuilding these methods step-by-step, I aim to strengthen my coding skills, improve problem-solving abilities, and gain insight into how foundational tools work under the hood. 
This project is an ongoing part of my journey to grow as a pythpn developer.

## Structure

- `src/` — function implementations  
- `tests/` — unit tests  
- `notebooks/` — demo notebooks for checkpoints  
- `examples/` — example usage scripts  

## How to use

- Implementations are pure Python without dependencies where possible.  
- Tests verify correctness and compare with standard libraries.  
- Notebooks show usage and small benchmarks.
